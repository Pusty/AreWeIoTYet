# Other Considered Operation Systems

## FreeRTOS

No official Rust support, neither [FreeRTOS-rust](https://github.com/lobaro/FreeRTOS-rust) or [freertos.rs](https://github.com/hashmismatch/freertos.rs) looked like they are in active development.

## Apache Mynewt

While there is a [Rust tutorial](https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/tutorials/other/rust.html) there doesn't seem too much information on official bindings and using Rust otherwise.

## Other + Rumble

We also looked at using (Rust) RTOS without their own BLE stacks in combination with [Rumble](https://github.com/mwylde/rumble) but that project also does not look like it is in active development.
